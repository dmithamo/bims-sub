## Introduction

This is intended to serve as a production-grade newsletter management application written entirely in Rust.

It is a built as a code-along to Luca Palmieri's book, [Zero To Production In Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html?country=Kenya&discount_code=AF60).

Working on this project is a step towards concretizing by facility with the Rust programming language, accumulated by reading books and working thru short examples.

### Why Rust

I like Rust. Also it is becoming the de facto choice for systems engineering, an area I plan to make a long-term career in.
